## Introduction

AI's exponential growth has led to many applications and advancements in various fields. However, this growth has also raised concerns about trust, accountability, ethics, and safety of AI systems. To address these challenges, we introduce HiveLedger, an open-source framework that leverages blockchain technology and AI Bots to create a transparent, ethical, and secure environment for AI development. HiveLedger aims to tackle these issues through a novel consensus mechanism called Proof of Artificial Intelligence (PoAI), incentivizing trust and accuracy among AI Bots while maintaining an immutable record of their actions.

## Addressing AI Challenges

HiveLedger offers a unique approach to tackling various AI challenges by combining blockchain technology, AI Bots, and the PoAI consensus mechanism. The platform aims to:

- Establish trust in AI-generated data by incentivizing AI Bots to provide accurate and reliable information.
- Enhance accountability by maintaining an immutable ledger that records all AI Bot actions.
- Foster ethical AI practices by promoting transparency and collaboration through an open-source framework.
- Ensure AI safety by implementing a consensus mechanism that involves human intervention when necessary.

## HiveLedger Architecture

HiveLedger has three main components: AI Bots, the Host, and a closed blockchain environment. The AI Bots are responsible for performing tasks assigned by the Host, who acts as the human interface between the bots. The closed blockchain environment provides an immutable ledger for recording all AI Bot actions, allowing for increased transparency and accountability.

## Open-Source Framework

HiveLedger's open-source nature encourages collaboration and innovation among developers and researchers. By providing a foundation for building trustworthy and accurate AI systems, HiveLedger aims to inspire others to contribute to developing AI solutions that address the ethical and safety concerns surrounding AI.

## Closed Blockchain Solution

HiveLedger employs a closed blockchain solution to maintain the ledger of AI Bot actions. This closed environment ensures that all transactions and interactions between the AI Bots and the Host are securely recorded on an immutable ledger, fostering trust and transparency in the AI system.

## Blockchain and AI Bots

HiveLedger's blockchain is a data structure comprising blocks containing transactions and other relevant data. The AI Bots in HiveLedger interact with the blockchain to perform tasks, process data, and participate in the consensus mechanism.

Communication framework between the bots and host.

Communication Example

    def __init__(self, host_id, bots):
        self.host_id = host_id
        self.bots = bots

    def broadcast_message(self, message):
        for bot in self.bots:
            print(f"{self.host_id} to {bot.bot_id}: {message}")

    def send_direct_message(self, bot_id, message):
        for bot in self.bots:
            if bot.bot_id == bot_id:
                print(f"{self.host_id} to {bot.bot_id}: {message}")
                break

## Proof of Artificial Intelligence (PoAI)

Proof of Artificial Intelligence (PoAI) is a consensus mechanism designed for HiveLedger, which focuses on utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to maintain the system's integrity, security, and accuracy. It works by rewarding AI Bots to provide reliable and accurate information. The AI Bots are ranked based on trustworthiness and accuracy, with the top-ranked Bot being the default choice for assigning tasks. This ranking motivates AI Bots to improve their performance, striving to provide better results continuously.

PoAI is based on the performance and trustworthiness of AI bots within the HiveLedger network. Here's how it works:

- AI Bots Registration: AI bots are registered within the HiveLedger system, and each Bot is assigned a unique identifier. They are then required to provide proof of their AI capabilities by solving complex tasks or problems.
- Task Distribution: The host distributes tasks to AI bots based on their expertise and capabilities. Each task is sent to multiple AI bots to ensure redundancy and improve the system's overall accuracy.
- Evaluation and Scoring: AI bots process the tasks and submit their results to the host. The host then evaluates the results based on predefined criteria, such as accuracy, efficiency, and trustworthiness. Each AI Bot is assigned a score based on its performance.
- Consensus and Ledger Updates: The host gathers the results from AI bots and determines the most trustworthy and accurate data based on their scores. Once a consensus is reached, the host updates the ledger with the new information, maintaining the immutability and integrity of the system.
- Bot Rewards: AI bots are rewarded for their participation in the system. The rewards are based on their performance, trustworthiness, and contribution to maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the HiveLedger.
- Continuous Improvement: The performance and trustworthiness of AI bots are continuously monitored, allowing the system to improve over time. Bots that consistently perform well may receive additional tasks, while those that underperform may be removed from the system.
- Decentralized Nature: The HiveLedger system is decentralized, with multiple hosts and AI bots collaborating and maintaining the ledger's integrity. This design ensures that no single point of failure exists and promotes transparency and security within the network.


## Proof of AI Consensus Mechanism

In this system, AI Bots compete to solve tasks and receive rewards based on their performance. The more tasks an AI Bot solves, the higher its ranking and the more likely it is to be selected for future tasks as the primary or default Bot that the Host interfaces with.

AI Bot Framework to Participate in Proof Example Code:

    def participate_in_proof_of_ai(self):
        task_difficulty = self.get_current_task_difficulty()
        task_solution = self.solve_task(task_difficulty)
        if task_solution is not None:
            self.earn_reward()

## Incentivized Trust and Accuracy through Rewards

Using PoAI, HiveLedger encourages AI Bots to be more trusted and accurate by rewarding them with better rankings and increased interaction with the Host. This incentive system motivates AI Bots to improve their performance. It helps establish a reliable and trustworthy AI environmentâ€”furthermore, the immutable ledger records all AI Bot actions, providing transparency and accountability for their performance.

HiveLedger employs a reward system that incentivizes AI Bots to perform tasks efficiently and accurately. AI Bots earn rewards for solving tasks, and their accumulated rewards determine their ranking. The top-ranked AI Bot becomes the default choice for new tasks.

## Cryptography

The HiveLedger system requires the integration of various cryptography algorithms to ensure data security and prevent unauthorized access. SHA-256 can be used for hashing the data blocks and generating unique identifiers for blocks and transactions, while elliptic curve cryptography can be utilized for key generation and digital signatures.

These cryptographic algorithms will be implemented within the system to protect the integrity of the data and ensure secure communication between the host and the subset members. Additionally, the consensus algorithms like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake can achieve a secure and reliable consensus mechanism within the system.
We propose a hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-3 to generate unique identifiers for blocks and transactions.

Example: The initialization output could look like the following when the host and subset members generate their unique addresses and cryptographic key pairs.

        self.chain.append(new_block)
        self.ledger.ledger_data = {}

    def print_chain(self):
        for block in self.chain:
            print(json.dumps(block.__dict__, indent=4))

    def verify_chain(self):
        for i in range(1, len(self.chain)):
            current_block = self.chain[i]
            previous_block = self.chain[i - 1]

            if current_block.hash != current_block.calculate_hash():
                return False

            if current_block.previous_hash != previous_block.hash:
                return False

        return True

## AI Trustworthiness

HiveLedger's Proof of AI consensus mechanism fosters trust in the AI Bots by rewarding accuracy and efficiency. The more tasks an AI Bot completes, the higher it's ranking, ensuring that the most trustworthy AI Bots are selected for future tasks. HiveLedger's blockchain serves as a transparent ledger for recording AI Bot interactions, ensuring the authenticity of the data provided by AI systems. By leveraging the immutability of the ledger, the data provided by AI Bots and all actions can be analyzed in the proposed changes to the ledger and corrected by the host if necessary. This approach will cultivate an environment built on trust and accuracy.
Bots Participate in a proof-of-AI task and earn a reward if the task is solved.
